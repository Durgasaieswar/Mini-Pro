	<h2>Political Career</h2>
	<p>cknowledging these issues, Rao defended his party saying no government in the past has spent this much amount of money for civic infrastructure. “The work we have done for Bengaluru will have far-reaching complications. We have set up STPs in Bangalore all over and by 2020-21 we will be the first city in India to have 100% sewage treated,” he said.</p>

<p>However he gets defensive when asked why Bengalureans should give the Congress one more chance to fix the city’s problems. “These are long-term issues and the solutions are also long-term. We understand there are problems in the city, but it cannot be solved overnight,” he says.</p>

<p>Bellandur is a problem which is being tackled in a serious way.  But it is not a problem we created but one we inherited. Before we came, Bengaluru was called ‘Garbage City’, he added.</p>

<p>“I think people will vote in large numbers for us because last time BJP government was a disaster. In terms of seats in Bengaluru, we should be getting 20 seats, the rest eight will be difficult as there the opposition candidates are well established. But we will definitely improve the figure,” he said. However, he, refused to point out the eight seats.</p>

<p>When asked about the spontaneous citizen movements against the government’s decisions and inactions, he insisted, “Bengaluru is not a stagnant city. People are coming here every day and the city is growing rapidly. So problems will crop up but the government is open to criticism.</p>

<p>Suggesting that the current government is a responsive government, “We did not go ahead with the steel flyover project. We are going briskly with our metro projects and Bengaluru’s traffic problems will be solved once the metro network is ready.</p>

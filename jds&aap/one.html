		<h2>Political Career</h2>
		<h3>The incumbent and his promises</h3>
		<p>The incumbent MLA is the five-time JDS MLA, Ramalinga Reddy. Reddy who won four times contesting from the Jayanagar constituency shifted to BTM after the delimitation of constituencies. Reddy claims to have done his best under the prevailing circumstances. According to Reddy, there is little he can do about the narrow streets and clogged sanitary as most of the constituency comes under revenue pockets and has already been fully built up with little scope for developing parks or playgrounds. He claims that much more work could have been done if the BJP-controlled BBMP was not partial with releasing funds for works in the constituency. If elected, Reddy promises to find solution to the main problem of the constituency : traffic.</p>
		 <p>In 2008 his assets were worth Rs 9.60 crore, with a liability of Rs 2.42 crores. In 2013, his declared assets are worth Rs 35.96 crore with liabilities of Rs 17.25 crore.</p>
		<p>The constituency has eight wards Lakkasandra, Adugodi, Ejipura, Koramangala, Suddagunte Palya, Madivala, Jakkasandra and BTM Layout. While BJP corporators represent Sudduguntepalya, Lakkasandra and Jakkasandra, the other five, BTM Layout, Madivala, Adugodi, Ejipura and Koramangala are held by the JDS.</p>

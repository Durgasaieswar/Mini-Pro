		<p>K.BAGEGOWDA
		BASAVANAGUDI (B.B.M.P(SOUTH))
		Party:JD(S) S/o|D/o|W/o: Late Kempaiah Age: 56 Address: 108, 13th Main Jayanagar 4th Block Bangalore -11 Name Enrolled as Voter in: Jayanagar (Karnataka) constituency,at Serial no 1127 in Part no 13</p>
		<h2>Political Career</h2>
		<p>bage gowda defeated JDS candidate N.S. Nandisha Reddy in the Assembly elections held in 2013 by a margin of 24,001 votes by polling 1,06,299 votes as against Nandisha Reddy’s 82,298 votes. Later, he played a key role in increasing the number of Congress corporators from basavangudi assembly constituency. The number of corporators was increased to six from one in 2010.</p>

<p>Jds corporators represent wards such as Horamavu, Basavanapura, Devasandra, A Narayanapura, Vignanana Nagar and HAL Airport in the BBMP Council.</p>
<p>Earlier, Poornima, the daughter of former minister late A Krishnappa was the only corporator to in the 2010 elections on jds ticket. However, Poornima quit jds and joined BJP to contest to the BBMP Council in 2015. “The specialty of Congress bage gowda is his philanthropy. He has succeeded in retaining K R Pura seat from BJP by strengthening Congress party at grassroots level. Earlier, this constituency was BJP’s strong forte but Nandish Reddy failed, despite having resources, to meet the expectations of needy people in this assembly constituency,’’ opines M Venkaiah, one of the voters of Nellorepuram.</p>

<p>The other advantage for Bage Gowda is his close proximity to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. He played a key role in having JD(S) alliance intact in the BBMP Council by not only garnering support from JD(S) corporators but also independents. :"bage gowda has made the BBMP engineers to prepare the reports on the developmental works to be taken up and got the funds under Nagarothana scheme. Many developmental works were taken up during the last five years,’’ Venkatesh Babu of Seegehalli said.</p>

<p>However, the proposal to take up some of the key developmental works remain on the paper. For example, the traffic snarls near the cable-stayed bridge (Tin Factory) continue to haunt the motorists. Many a time, Bage gowda visited the spot along with BBMP engineers but till now nothing has been done to fix this problem. The other issue is Benniganahalli Lake which is set to join the list dying lakes in Bengaluru. The other one is the railway over bridge at Kaggaadasapura railway cross.</p>

<p>We have been complaining about the bad condition of this lake. Many attempts were made to revive this lake all these years but in vain. If this lake is revived, the groundwater table will be increased in areas such as Benniganahalli, Pai Layout, Kasturinagar, Vijanapura,’’ opines Venkatesh M, a resident of Benniganahalli.</p>

<p>The other issues are the maintenance of Government Hospital and vegetable market at Basavangudi. There are many complaints about the poor services and lack of doctors at the Government Hospital. There is nothing to revel about the facilities at the vegetable market. “We are grateful to Bage Gowda for taking measures to construct the much-needed skywalk in front of this market. We want MLA to ensure garbage contractor to clear garbage on a regular basis,’’ said Sreenivas M, a vegetable vendor.</p>

<p>All in all, BageGowda is set to retain Basavangudi if BJP fails to do the much-needed introspection on the defeat of its candidate in 2013 elections and gears up to give a strong fight in 2018 Assembly elections.</p>

		<p>B.Z.ZAMEER AHMED KHAN (Winner)
		CHAMRAJAPET (B.B.M.P(CENTRAL))
		Party:JD(S) S/o|D/o|W/o: Late Ziaulla Khan Age: 48 Address: No. 34, Benson Cross Road, Benson Town Banglore 560046 Name Enrolled as Voter in: 162 Shivaji Nagar (Karnataka) constituency, at Serial no 1028 in Part no 31</p>
		<h2>Political Career</h2>
		<p>B. Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan is a member of the Legislative Assembly & former General Secretary of the Karnataka Pradesh Janata Dal (Secular).[1] Khan was the former Minister for the Haj and Wakf Board for government of Karnataka and three consistent times MLA From Chamrajpet Constituency.</p>

		<p>In 2005, when S. M. Krishna appointment as Maharashtra governor, paved the way for Zameer's political growth. When Krishna vacated Chamarajpet seat to take up the governor's post, JD(S) fielded Zameer who went to beat Krishna's lieutenant R. V. Devraj. Subsequently, Zameer was sworn in as Haj and wakf minister in the JDS-BJP coalition government under H D Kumaraswamy's chief ministership. A three -time MLA, Zameer is a partner in National Travels, a transport company in the state. Zameer Ahmed Khan's Birthday is on 1 August.</p>

		<p>In 2016, Khan was one of 7 JD(S) MLAs suspended for cross voting for candidates of different parties in the 2016 Rajya Sabha election.</p>
		<p>At the rally, Parameshwara said while Muslim leaders like Azeez Sait were no more and C K Jaffer Sharief had aged, the Congress rank and file still had tall Muslim leaders. But now, perhaps the most trusted name in the community and within the Congress is Khan," he said quoting the KPCC chief.</p>
		<p>Khan, who has been working out a poll strategy to contest from Chamarajapet again on a Congress ticket, said the polarisation of votes in the Uttar Pradesh polls would benefit him in the upcoming Karnataka elections.</p>
		<p>"The Muslim population in the country feels that Congress is the only party they can bank upon, for a peaceful existence. Even if I had remained in JD (S) and contested on their ticket, I wouldn't have got the Muslim votes. In a way, God has paved the way for me to join Congress," he said.</p>

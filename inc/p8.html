 <h3>PROMISES</h3>
  <p>BENGALURU: With the Assembly Election just a few months away, Bengaluru Development Minister K J George on Thursday promised that all city roads will be smoother and better in the next four months. Bengaluru is not a planned city. Civic utilities were laid under the roads and this needs to be rectified, he said.</p>

 <p>George, who attended a review meeting on ongoing projects in the city which was chaired by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, later spoke to reporters and said, “Bengaluru has 1500 km of major roads of which 500 km will be asphalted afresh. Work orders have been issued to contractors who are expected to complete it by December. Asphalting will be done better than previous occasions and will be thicker too,’’ he said. Along with asphalting, footpath and drain, works will also be taken up.</p >

 <p>George also said the white-topping of roads has been taken up on 100 km. “We want to make all major roads white-topped in the coming years. This apart, 20 km of roads will be developed under TenderSURE. All these works are expected to be completed in the next three to four months.”George also said the white-topping of roads has been taken up on 100 km. “We want to make all major roads white-topped in the coming years. This apart, 20 km of roads will be developed under TenderSURE. All these works are expected to be completed in the next three to four months.</p>
  <p>Regarding high-density corridors like Old Madras Road, Bellary Road and Old airport Road, George said they will have better footpaths, raised medians, better streetlights, bus bays and signages for safety by December 10. After a request from IT giants, the government will develop 14 roads (80 km) that will connect Sarjapur Outer Ring Road at a cost of `500 crore of which `150 crore will be released as first instalment. The Hennur flyover will also be ready by December, he said.</p>

<p>The minister said the signal-free corridor from Old Airport Road to Hope Farm junction was delayed due to land acquisition issues. “We have sorted it out partly. While NAL and ISRO agreed to give 910 sqmt of land near Wind Tunnel Road, HAL too agreed to give 3,100 sqmt on Suranjan Das Road on the condition that we develop alternative road at a cost of  `58 crore. Even at Kundalahalli we have acquired land. The only problem is at Hope Farm where private property owners are not agreeing to give up their land. If needed, we will issue land acquisition notices under emergency and we will pay them double the market price,he said.</p>

18 mobile canteens
<p>George said 141 Indira Canteens are ready and another five are under construction. However, they have not got land for 18 canteens and hence decided to start mobile Indira Canteens at open spaces.

Sluice gate at Bellandur
<p>As water is stagnant at Bellandur lake, water from storm water drains is not going into the lake but flowing backwards, causing flooding. “We have told BDA told install sluice gate at the end of lake,” George said.</p>

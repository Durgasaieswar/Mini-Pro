<h2>IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY : Krishna Byregowda wants ‘spot surgery’</h2>
<p>Bangalore: Agriculture minister Krishna Byregowda intends to conduct ‘spot surgery’ to bring in accountability among department officials.
Spot surgery was a system adopted by his father C Byregowda as agriculture minister. He used to suspend officials on the spot following a complaint. “There are varied kinds of technology to monitor progress of the department. However, visiting the spot is needed some times,” Byregowda said on Tuesday after holding a review meeting with department officials.
He said the government has an open mind on the issue of Genetically Modified (GM) crops and favors giving options to farmers to make informed choices. According to him, BT cotton, introduced in the state one-and-half decades ago, has benefited farmers to improve yields in an Eco-friendly manner. Batting for Bt, the new agriculture minister said people and government should keep their minds open. “We must give him (farmer) the options; let them choose”.
Slamming the fertilizer and seed mafia for creating “artificial scarcity” of fertilizers, Byregowda said a special squad has been formed to crack down on elements who seek to create artificial shortage by hoarding.</p>
<h3>Underground Drainage Works</h3>
<p>With the financial aid from the World Bank, Central and State Governments (50%, 35% and 15% respectively) for providing Health and Cleanliness to the citizens of Byatarayanapura Assembly Constituency, UGD works undertaken. The cost of the project is approx. Rs. 250 Crores. Long outstanding underground drinage works have been undertaken in ward 7 to ward 11, this will be completed in the coming months.
Krishna’s priority is to provide underground drainage facilities in wards 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Roads play an integral part in the day to day life of the people. Enhances the organization and well being of any constituency. Civil works were undertaken at an expenditure exceeding Rs. 190 crore to facilitate smooth flow of traffic in Byatarayanapura covering a total of 52 kilometers.
